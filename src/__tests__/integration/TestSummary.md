- File system permission errors
- Notification service failures
- Configuration validation errors
- Multiple simultaneous failures
- Memory and resource constraints

### Performance Metrics Validated
- Memory growth limits (50MB during extended monitoring)
- Peak memory usage (200MB limit)
- Memory efficiency (10MB/s growth rate limit)
- Check frequency (minimum 5 checks per second)
- Execution time constraints
- Resource cleanup verification

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run specific test categories
npx jest src/__tests__/integration/SimpleIntegration.test.ts
npx jest src/__tests__/integration/BasicIntegration.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
VERBOSE_TESTS=1 npm run test:integration
```

### Test Configuration
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds for complex integration tests
- **Execution**: Sequential to avoid port conflicts
- **Mocking**: All external dependencies properly mocked
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of test data and resources

## Mock Server Capabilities

The MockIELTSServer provides comprehensive simulation:

### Endpoints
- `GET /timetable` - Main appointment data endpoint
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /admin/appointments` - Set appointment data
- `POST /admin/failure` - Configure failure simulation
- `POST /admin/delay` - Set response delays
- `GET /admin/stats` - Get server statistics

### Failure Simulation
- Network errors (500, timeout, connection refused)
- Parsing errors (invalid HTML structure)
- Response delays for performance testing
- Intermittent failure patterns

## Performance Testing Results

The performance tests validate:

### Memory Management
- ✅ Memory growth stays within acceptable limits
- ✅ No memory leaks during multiple monitoring cycles
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup after monitoring stops
- ✅ Garbage collection effectiveness

### Execution Efficiency
- ✅ High-frequency checks complete within time limits
- ✅ Concurrent operations don't cause resource conflicts
- ✅ Error recovery doesn't impact performance significantly
- ✅ System remains responsive under load

## Integration with Existing Codebase

### Service Integration
- Tests work with existing MonitorController
- Compatible with current service architecture
- Validates actual service interactions
