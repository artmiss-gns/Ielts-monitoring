- **Export inspection data in multiple formats**: Tested JSON, text, and CSV export functionality
- **Display inspection statistics correctly**: Validated calculation of availability rates, average appointments per check, and record counts

#### 2. Enhanced Logging System ✅
- **Capture detailed parsing information**: Verified that comprehensive logging details including detected elements, parsing notes, and raw HTML are preserved
- **Format enhanced logging output correctly**: Tested formatting methods handle special characters and generate proper detailed reports
- **Raw HTML snippet collection**: Confirmed that raw appointment HTML is captured for debugging purposes

#### 3. Performance Testing ✅
- **Handle large inspection data sets efficiently**: Tested creation, retrieval, and export of 20+ inspection records within performance limits
- **Memory efficiency with cleanup**: Verified automatic cleanup of old inspection records maintains memory efficiency
- **Export performance**: Confirmed JSON, text, and CSV exports complete within acceptable time limits

#### 4. Notification Filtering Logic ✅
- **Validate filtering by appointment status**: Confirmed that only available appointments trigger notifications
- **Mixed appointment scenario handling**: Tested proper categorization of available vs filled appointments
- **Inspection data captures filtering results**: Verified that filtering decisions are logged in inspection data

#### 5. CLI Command Functionality ✅
- **Data export in multiple formats**: Successfully tested export to JSON, text, and CSV formats
- **Statistics display**: Verified proper calculation and display of inspection statistics
- **Detailed inspection output**: Confirmed generation of comprehensive inspection reports
