# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an automated monitoring system for IELTS exam appointments on the irsafam.org website. The system will continuously check for new available appointment slots based on user-specified criteria (city, exam type, month) and send immediate notifications when new appointments become available. This addresses the problem of appointments filling up quickly by providing real-time alerts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an IELTS exam candidate, I want to monitor appointment availability automatically, so that I can be notified immediately when new slots open up without manually checking the website repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts monitoring THEN it SHALL check the irsafam.org IELTS timetable page every 30 seconds for new appointments
2. WHEN truly available appointments are detected (not filled slots) THEN the system SHALL send an immediate notification to the user
3. WHEN the system encounters network errors THEN it SHALL retry the request after 60 seconds and log the error
4. IF the website structure changes THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully and notify the user of the issue
5. WHEN appointments are filled (showing "تکمیل ظرفیت" status) THEN the system SHALL NOT send notifications but SHALL log them as filled slots
6. WHEN no appointment slots exist for a month THEN the system SHALL log this as "no slots available" and NOT send notifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure specific search criteria, so that I only get notified about appointments that match my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the monitor THEN the system SHALL allow selection of city (default: Isfahan)
2. WHEN configuring the monitor THEN the system SHALL allow selection of exam model (default: CDIELTS)
3. WHEN configuring the monitor THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific months to monitor
4. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent startup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications through multiple channels, so that I don't miss any new appointment alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new appointments are found THEN the system SHALL send notifications
2. WHEN new appointments are found THEN the system SHALL play an audio alert
3. WHEN new appointments are found THEN the system SHALL log detailed appointment information (date, time, location)
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry notification delivery and log the failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the monitoring status and history, so that I can verify the system is working correctly and review past notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL display current monitoring status (active/paused/stopped)
2. WHEN appointments are checked THEN the system SHALL log the timestamp, appointment type (available/filled/none), and detailed appointment data
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL maintain a history of all notifications sent
4. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL display statistics about monitoring sessions (uptime, checks performed, notifications sent)
5. WHEN appointments are detected THEN the system SHALL log the specific appointment status (available for booking, filled, or no slots)
6. WHEN logging appointment data THEN the system SHALL include appointment details (date, time, exam type, status) for verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the monitoring process, so that I can start, pause, or stop monitoring as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL provide options to start, stop, or configure monitoring
2. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide a way to pause monitoring temporarily
3. WHEN the user requests to stop THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down and save current state
4. WHEN resuming from pause THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring with the same configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer/user, I want to inspect the raw appointment data being detected, so that I can verify the system is correctly parsing and categorizing appointments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects appointments THEN it SHALL save detailed appointment data to a separate inspection file
2. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide a CLI command to display the latest parsed appointment data
3. WHEN appointments are parsed THEN the system SHALL categorize them as: available, filled, or no-slots-available
4. WHEN displaying inspection data THEN the system SHALL show appointment details including status, date, time, and raw HTML elements for verification
5. WHEN multiple appointment types are found THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between available slots and filled slots in the inspection output
