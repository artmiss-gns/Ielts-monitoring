# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an automated monitoring system for IELTS exam appointments on the irsafam.org website. The system will continuously check for new available appointment slots based on user-specified criteria (city, exam type, month) and send immediate notifications when new appointments become available. This addresses the problem of appointments filling up quickly by providing real-time alerts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an IELTS exam candidate, I want to monitor appointment availability automatically, so that I can be notified immediately when new slots open up without manually checking the website repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts monitoring THEN it SHALL check the irsafam.org IELTS timetable page every 30 seconds for new appointments
2. WHEN new appointments are detected THEN the system SHALL send an immediate notification to the user
3. WHEN the system encounters network errors THEN it SHALL retry the request after 60 seconds and log the error
4. IF the website structure changes THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully and notify the user of the issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure specific search criteria, so that I only get notified about appointments that match my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the monitor THEN the system SHALL allow selection of city (default: Isfahan)
2. WHEN configuring the monitor THEN the system SHALL allow selection of exam model (default: CDIELTS)
3. WHEN configuring the monitor THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific months to monitor
4. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent startup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications through multiple channels, so that I don't miss any new appointment alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new appointments are found THEN the system SHALL send notifications
2. WHEN new appointments are found THEN the system SHALL play an audio alert
3. WHEN new appointments are found THEN the system SHALL log detailed appointment information (date, time, location)
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry notification delivery and log the failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the monitoring status and history, so that I can verify the system is working correctly and review past notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL display current monitoring status (active/paused/stopped)
2. WHEN appointments are checked THEN the system SHALL log the timestamp and number of appointments found
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL maintain a history of all notifications sent
4. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL display statistics about monitoring sessions (uptime, checks performed, notifications sent)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the monitoring process, so that I can start, pause, or stop monitoring as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL provide options to start, stop, or configure monitoring
2. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide a way to pause monitoring temporarily
3. WHEN the user requests to stop THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down and save current state
4. WHEN resuming from pause THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring with the same configuration
