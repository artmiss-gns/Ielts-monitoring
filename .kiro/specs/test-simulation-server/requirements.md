# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a test simulation server that mimics the IELTS appointment booking website structure and behavior. The simulation allows developers to test the appointment monitoring system by providing a controllable environment where new appointment slots can be dynamically added and removed. The server serves web pages that can be viewed in a browser and provides API endpoints to trigger appointment changes for testing purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a local test server that mimics the IELTS website structure, so that I can test the monitoring system without depending on the real website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test server is started THEN it SHALL serve HTML pages that mimic the structure of the real IELTS appointment booking pages
2. WHEN a browser accesses the test server URL THEN it SHALL display appointment slots in a format similar to the real website
3. WHEN the test server is running THEN it SHALL be accessible via a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:3001)
4. IF the test server is stopped THEN it SHALL gracefully shut down and release the port

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trigger new appointment availability through a simple mechanism, so that I can test how the monitoring system detects and responds to changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a trigger script or command THEN the test server SHALL add new appointment slots to the available appointments
2. WHEN new appointments are added THEN they SHALL be immediately visible when refreshing the browser page
3. WHEN I trigger appointment changes THEN the monitoring system SHALL detect these changes within its normal polling interval
4. IF no appointments are available initially THEN the trigger mechanism SHALL be able to add the first appointments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the simulation to use realistic appointment data structure, so that the monitoring system processes it correctly without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test server serves appointment data THEN it SHALL use HTML structure and CSS classes similar to the real IELTS website
2. WHEN appointment slots are displayed THEN they SHALL include realistic date, time, and location information
3. WHEN the monitoring system scrapes the test server THEN it SHALL be able to parse the data using existing scraping logic
4. IF the real website structure changes THEN the test server structure SHALL be easily updatable to match

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the simulation to be completely separate from the main codebase, so that testing doesn't interfere with production code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation is created THEN it SHALL be in a separate `test-simulation/` directory at the project root level
2. WHEN running tests THEN the simulation SHALL not modify any files in the src/ directory or other main project files
3. WHEN the simulation server runs THEN it SHALL use a different port from any production services (e.g., port 3001)
4. WHEN the simulation has its own package.json THEN it SHALL manage its own dependencies separately from the main project
5. IF the simulation is removed THEN it SHALL not affect the main application functionality
6. WHEN the simulation is added to .gitignore THEN it SHALL optionally be excluded from version control if desired

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple controls to manage appointment availability, so that I can easily test different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to add appointments THEN I SHALL be able to run a simple script or command
2. WHEN I want to clear all appointments THEN I SHALL be able to reset the server state
3. WHEN I want to modify existing appointments THEN I SHALL be able to update them through the control mechanism
4. WHEN appointments are modified THEN the changes SHALL persist until the server is restarted or manually changed
